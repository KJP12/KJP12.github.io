My personal site, not much to see here. Can be seen as a proof of concept of a responsive site with little CSS and no
JavaScript.

## Logos

The [GitHub](https://github.com/logos), [Ko-Fi](https://more.ko-fi.com/brand-assets) and
[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) logos within [assets](assets) are purely used for linking to my personal profiles on
those sites, while keeping within any existing branding guidelines where it exists.
